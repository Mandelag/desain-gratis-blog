The name **desain gratis** is an Indonesian phrase for free design. It's a pun on "desain grafis" (graphic design).

It refers to a common phenomenon in which graphic design job doesn't pay enough / or not even paid.

In this blog however, I use it to learn and research tech development design pattern. I'll also share exciting open source library that caught my interest.

Stay tuned.
