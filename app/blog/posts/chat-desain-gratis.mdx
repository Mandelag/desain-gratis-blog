Can see it here [chat.desain.gratis](https://chat.desain.gratis).

Key learnings:

This is fundamental, I design as an fundamental OLAP design pattern that complements my  mycontent OLTP library.

Why not use simple cron?

Simply to make it more fault tolerant (cloud VMs can crash). I want my function / process be run reliably.
